1. Create a BankAccount class

2. Every bank account should have balance and interest_rate attributes.
At this point you should test out creating an instance of your
class to make sure it works.

3. Your class should have an instance method called deposit that accepts
one amount argument and adds that amount to the total balance.
Test out your method by calling it on an instance of your class.

4. There should be a withdraw instance method that accepts one amount
argument and subtracts it from the total balance.
Don't forget to test it out!

5. Finally, there should be a gain_interest instance method that
increases the total balance according to the interest rate.
Once all of that is working, don't forget to commit!
